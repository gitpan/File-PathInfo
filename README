File::PathInfo - oo access to path variables stat data about a file on disk
===========================================================================

This provides an object oriented interface to things you want to know about a file, such
as extension, absolute path, relative path, size, filename (without extension), etc.
It is a sort of swissarmy knife of file info.

A lot of times you need to know a file's absolute path, it's absolute
location, maybe it's relative location to something else (like DOCUMENT ROOT),
then you need to maybe know the relative path and relative location for a file.
You need to know if a file is a directory, what it's extension is. 
You can commonly use regexes to do this.

This module provides commonly needed variables.

See doc for full description.
